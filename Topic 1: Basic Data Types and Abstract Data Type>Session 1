Session 1
Practice Problem Set

Q1 Select the correct alternative(s) which is/are some default built-in data types provided in C++ ?

Ans.
char,
long double

Q2 Consider the C++ code snippet given below.
   #include<iostream>
   using namespace std;
    int main() {
    double a, i;
    cin >> a >> i;
    cout << a << i;
    } 
    
    Select all the variable(s) and function(s) present in the above code.
    
    Ans.
    main(),
    a,
    i.
    a and i are the variables while double is their datatype/structure, main() is the function, while cin and cout are the objects of       type istream and ostream respectively.
    
 Q3 Consider we have the following two data structures in C++:
    struct zebra{
    string parrot;
    float cobra;
    };
    
   class tiger{
   public:
    string dog;
    float eagle;
    
    char cat(){
      // some operations here
    }
    
    string lion(string human){
      // some operations here
      return human;
    }
   };
   
   Ans.
   s1=s2
   Both the data structures occupy the same amount of memory. The function declarations made in the class tiger do not occupy space in 
   an instance of the class.
